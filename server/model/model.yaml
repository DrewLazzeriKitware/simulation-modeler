    _parflowId: Solver
    _help: ParFlow can operate using a number of different solvers. Two of these solvers,
      IMPES (running in single-phase, fully-saturated mode, not multiphase) and RICHARDS
      (running in variably-saturated mode, not multiphase, with the options of land
      surface processes and coupled overland flow) are detailed below. This is a brief
      summary of solver settings used to simulate under three sets of conditions,
      fully-saturated, variably saturated and variably-saturated with overland flow.
      To simulate fully saturated, steady-state conditions set the solver to IMPES.
      This is also the default solver in ParFlow, so if no solver is specified, the
      code solves using IMPES. To simulate variably-saturated, transient conditions,
      using Richards’ equation, variably/fully saturated, transient with compressible
      storage set the solver to RICHARDS. This is also the solver used to simulate
      surface flow or coupled surface-subsurface flow.

      length [m] DISPLA: Displacement height [m] In the case of 1D meteorological
      forcings, CLM requires four files for vegetation time series and one vegetation
      map. The four files should be named respectively lai.dat, sai.dat, z0m.dat,
      displa.dat. They are ASCII files and contain 18 time-series columns (one per
      IGBP vegetation class, and each timestep per row). The vegetation map should
      be a properly distributed 2D ParFlow binary file (.pfb) which contains vegetation
      indices (from 1 to 18). The vegetation map filename is veg_map.pfb. ParFlow
      uses the vegetation map to pass to CLM a 2D map for each vegetation variable
      at each time step. In the case of 3D meteorological forcings, ParFlow expects
      four distincts properly distributed ParFlow binary file (.pfb), the third dimension
      being the timesteps. The files should be named LAI.pfb, SAI.pfb, Z0M.pfb, DISPLA.pfb.

      1D and 2D and 3D cases, as sepcified by the Solver.CLM.MetForcing key above.

      forcing file is not distributed, the user does not provide copies such as narr.1hr.txt.0,
      narr.1hr.txt.1 for each processor. ParFlow only needs the single original file
      (e.g. narr.1hr.txt). For 2D cases, this key is the BASE FILE NAME for the 2D
      forcing files, currently set to NLDAS, with individual files determined as follows

      has no default so the user must set it to 1D, 2D or 3D. Failure to set this
      key will cause CLM to still be run but with unpredictable values causing CLM
      to eventually crash. 1D meteorological forcing files are text files with single

      files. This is particually useful for large, distributed runs when the user
      wants to run ParFlow at a smaller timestep than the CLM forcing. Forcing files

      layers correspond to the 2-D CLM outputs and the remaining layers are the soil
      temperatures in each layer. For example, a model with 4 soil layers will create
      a SingleFile CLM output with 17 layers at each time step. The file pseudo code

      without averaging (i.e. assuming a face centered slope calculation). The UpwindSine
      is the same as the Upwind option but it also removes the Sine term from 5.8.
      Note the UpwindSine option is for experimental purposes only and should not
      be used in standard simulations. Also note that the choice of upwind orOriginal
      formulation should consistent with the choice of overland flow boundary condition
      if overland flow is being used. The upwind and UpwindSine are consistent with
      OverlandDiffusive and OverlandKinematic while Original is consistent with OverlandFlow.

      multigrid algorithm which uses a point relaxation method. The choice SMG specifies
      a semi-coarsening multigrid algorithm which uses plane relaxations. This method
      is more robust than MGSemi, but generally requires more memory and compute time.
