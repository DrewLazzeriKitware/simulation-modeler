      By default an octree representation is used for iteration, this may result in

      algorithm to build a set of boxes for iteration. This does not always have a
      significant impact on performance and the clustering algorithm can be expensive
      to compute. For small problems and short running problems clustering is not
      recommended. Long running problems may or may not see a benefit. The result
      varies significantly based on the geometries in the problem. The Berger-Rigoutsos
      algorithm is currently used for clustering.

    _help: This key specifies optional modifications to the terrain following grid
      formulation (Equation 5.8) . Choices for this key are Original, Upwind, UpwindSine.
      Original is the original TFG formulation shown in Equation 5.8 in the manual.
      The Original option calculates the theta-x and theta-y for a cell face as the
      average of the two adjacent cell slopes (i.e. assuming a cell centered slope
      calculation). The Upwind option uses the the theta-x and theta-y of a cell directly
      without averaging (i.e. assuming a face centered slope calculation). The UpwindSine
      is the same as the Upwind option but it also removes the Sine term from 5.8.
      Note the UpwindSine option is for experimental purposes only and should not
      be used in standard simulations. Also note that the choice of upwind orOriginal
      formulation should consistent with the choice of overland flow boundary condition
      if overland flow is being used. The upwind and UpwindSine are consistent with
      OverlandDiffusive and OverlandKinematic while Original is consistent with OverlandFlow.
