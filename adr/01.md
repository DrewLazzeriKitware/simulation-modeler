# ADR 01: Web interface to solver keys
We want a straightforward interface to the 20% of parflow that 80% of the hydrologists use. Our interface will have some assumptions baked in, some shortcuts the user can choose, and then interfaces to solver keys.

## Baked in
### We will assume that the user is only using water. 
Anecdotally, Reed said other phases were rare.
### We will assume that they have an indicator file which we can derive geometry from.
- Can a solidfile (.pfsol) be the indicator? 
> It seems a pfsol file describes patches but not indications (subsections). 
### We will assume that we can derive a box geometry for their domain from the indicator file. 
- Can the indicator be the domain? 
> It seems an indicator file does not describe patches, which the domain must, so we'll use a box.
- Can a solidfile be the domain?
> Yes, and sandtank does this. I don't know a way to render pfsol files in paraview though. I'm assuming this is hard, until I get an answer about  about rendering pfsol. 

## Shortcuts
Following work on [DomainBuilder](https://github.com/parflow/parflow/blob/32db1dcb12402ccd0bf2ac8afe61740bdbec3604/docs/pf-keys/tutorials/domain_builder.rst) we will start the interface with options such as: 
- NoWells 
- NoContaminants 
- VariablySaturated | FullySaturated

## Interface

# Questions
Can paraview render a pfsol file?
