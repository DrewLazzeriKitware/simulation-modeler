# ADR 01: Web interface to solver keys
We want a straightforward interface to the 20% of parflow that 80% of the hydrologists use. Our interface will have some assumptions baked in, some shortcuts the user can choose, and then interfaces to solver keys.

For each of the following sections, there is a section in draft.py organizing the relevant keys.

# Baked in

## We assume that the user is only using water. 
Anecdotally, Reed said other phases were rare. Also, the docs for Solver say that both Richards and Impes assume they are not multi-phase.

## We assume that they have an indicator file (.pfb) which we can derive geometry from.
It will be a child of indi_input
- Can a solidfile (.pfsol) be the indicator? 
> It seems a pfsol file describes patches but not indications (subsections). 

## We assume that we can derive a box geometry for their domain from the indicator file. 
According to the keys, Domain.GeomName is mandatory and must have patches that equal the entire domain surface.
- Can the indicator be the domain? 
> It seems an indicator file does not describe patches, which the domain must, so we'll use a box.
- Can a solidfile be the domain?
> Yes, and sandtank does this. I don't know a way to render pfsol files in paraview though. I'm assuming this is hard, until I get an answer about  about rendering pfsol. 

## We assume there is no known solution
That sounds like a workflow that goes out of our scope, and I'll assume it is until hearing otherwise.

# Shortcuts
Following work on [DomainBuilder](https://github.com/parflow/parflow/blob/32db1dcb12402ccd0bf2ac8afe61740bdbec3604/docs/pf-keys/tutorials/domain_builder.rst) we will start the interface with options such as: 

## NoWells 
This just sets empty. 

## NoContaminants 
This just sets empty

## VariablySaturated | FullySaturated

# Interface

## File Database Page

## Geometry Page
### We assume most geometry can be inferred from the indicator file
It's possible that the d{xyz} can't be, but documentations suggests it should. I have a reasonable guess if we can't get anything from the file.

## Soil Properties Page

### Properties like SpecificStorage might be different per section: Constant, Turnbands, ParGauss etc.
We'll need a form for each of the soil indications which captures the different options. 
We might have a summary like the tables, since that view is useful (especially for consts).
### We assume Mannings can't be set per indicator because it's on a surface patch

## Solver Page
### 

# Questions
Can paraview render a pfsol file? 
Can we assume KnownSolution ="NoKnownSolution"? (What is the workflow of someone using this?)
How does one make a pfb file? (Is it hard, so people prefer to make one then assign indices/indications?)
Does the DomainBuilder's homogeneous_subsurface overlap the SubsurfacePropertiesBuilder?
