# ADR 01: Web interface to solver keys
We want a straightforward interface to the 20% of parflow that 80% of the hydrologists use. Our interface will have some assumptions baked in, some shortcuts the user can choose, and then interfaces to solver keys.

## Baked in
We will assume that the user is only using water. Anecdotally, Reed said other phases were rare.
We will assume that they have a box geometry describing their domain. 
We will assume that they have an indicator file which we can derive geometry from.

## Shortcuts
Following work on [DomainBuilder](https://github.com/parflow/parflow/blob/32db1dcb12402ccd0bf2ac8afe61740bdbec3604/docs/pf-keys/tutorials/domain_builder.rst) we will start the interface with options such as: 
- NoWells | Wells
- NoContaminants | Contaminants
- VariablySaturated | FullySaturated
